## [Problem 002](https://projecteuler.net/problem=2)

Each new term in the Fibonacci sequence is generated by adding the previous two terms. By starting with `1` and `2`, the first 10 terms will be:

	1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13, 21, 34, 55, 89, ...

By considering the terms in the Fibonacci sequence whose values do not exceed `N`, find the sum of the even-valued terms.

#### Input Format

First line contains `T` that denotes the number of test cases. This is followed by `T` lines, each containing an integer, `N`. 

#### Output Format

Print the required answer for each test case. 

#### Sample Input

	2
	10
	100

#### Sample Output

	10
	44

### Explanation

+ For, `N = 10`, we have `{2, 8}`, the sum is `10`.
+ For, `N = 100`, we have `{2, 8, 34}`, the sum is `44`.
