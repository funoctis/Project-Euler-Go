## [Problem 010](https://projecteuler.net/problem=10)

The sum of the primes below `10` is `2 + 3 + 5 + 7 = 17`.

Find the sum of all the primes not greater than given `N`.

#### Input Format

The first line contains an integer `T` i.e. number of the test cases.
The next `T` lines will contains an integer `N`.

#### Output Format

Print the value corresponding to each test case in separate line.

#### Sample Input

	2
	5
	10

#### Sample Output

	10
	17

### Explanation

+ For `N = 5`, we have primes as `{2, 3, 5}` and the sum is `10`.
+ For `N = 10`, we have primes as `{2, 3, 5, 7}` and the sum is `17`.
